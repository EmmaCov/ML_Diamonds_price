# ML_Diamonds_price

THe goal of the project is to implement some of the main algorithms seen in class Batch gradient descent, Nesterov gradient descent, Stochastic gradient descent, Ridge and Lasso regularizations.

The choice of the database was free, it had to had approx 10,000 examples.

The use of the sklearn library was forbidden, unless it was to check whether the "by-hand" implementation was correct. Some exploration over the hyperparameters was expected.
